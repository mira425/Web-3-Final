            <h4>The length of this saw allows a full motion, without being long enough to buckle with too much pressure.
                For a novice carpenter, more accustomed to power tools, this does the trick for 4 x 4s or the like where I
                can't get the whole way through a post/stud/plank with my chop saw.</h4>

            <h4>Adam Sandler</h4>
            <h4>It is light and very effective. Will repurchase. </h4>

            <h4>Tim Smith</h4>
            <h4>Very light weight and compact. The teeth are very sharp. Great for close quarter cutting.</h4>

            <h4>Samantha Thompson</h4>
            <h4>I've had this and the companion crosscut saw for about a year. Both are flawless, beautiful, easy to use
                tools. This saw has helped me begin to master hand cut dovetails.</h4>

            <h4>Big Tony</h4>
            <h4>The grip is fantastic and allows for full use of motion. Excellent quality for price, but shipping time
                was four weeks longer than originally stated.</h4>

            <h4>Billy Wilson</h4>
            <h4>The tool does all of the work for you. Just line it up and squeeze. The only issue I had was that the
                plastic above the action needs the light right above it or the shadow makes it difficult to see the
                teeth. Once you figure out how to line it up, it does the job.</h4>

            <h4>Craig Moore</h4>
            <h4>Lie-Nielsen's reputation for their superior craftsmanship is again maintained with this finely made saw.
                Well balanced, a joy to hold and use. Perfectly tuned right out of the box. Doesn't hurt that it looks
                great too.</h4>

            <h4>Sadie Lewis</h4>
            <h4>These saws are brilliant. Whether you keep the hybrid tooth shape or file fully rip cut, they cross cut
                really well. As supplied they will rip cut reasonably well. Filed rip they fly through thin wood. For
                thicker stuff, buy the longer version which has larger teeth.</h4>
