                <h2>Use</h2>

                <h6 class="hsixdetails">Best performance is obtained by sawing slowly and evenly with very little downward pressure, using
                    as
                    much
                    of
                    the blade as possible. Your saw will track right to the line. Be aware, however, that due to the
                    slight
                    set,
                    your saw will be hard to correct if it starts to cut away from the line. If that happens, it's
                    because
                    you
                    didn't line it up properly when you started.</h6>
