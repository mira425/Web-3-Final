                <h2>Use</h2>
                
                <h5>Best performance is obtained by sawing slowly and evenly with very little downward pressure, using as much of the blade as possible. Your saw will track right to the line. Be aware, however, that due to the slight set, your saw will be hard to correct if it starts to cut away from the line. If that happens, it's because you didn't line it up properly when you started.</h5>
